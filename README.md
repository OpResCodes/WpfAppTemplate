# WpfAppTemplate
My ready to use MVVM WPF Application template. 


# Usage
Add the .zip file your Visual Studio Templates folder.
The templates folder is 

Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates\Visual C#\

You can then find the template if you search for WPF when creating a new project.

I will add some documentation soon. But for now, this is what I use to get going quickly. :)
